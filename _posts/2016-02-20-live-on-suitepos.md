_The world's largest confectionary emporium and lifestyle brand goes live on SuiteRetail's SuitePOS for NetSuite and takes advantage of the fastest POS solution available for omnichannel retailers on NetSuite._

Dylan's Candy Bar, pioneered by Dylan Lauren (daughter of Ralph Lauren), is using SuitePOS for NetSuite on Apple iOS devices at every location nationwide and has benefitted immensely by the speed, ease of use, tight integration with NetSuite and their ability to serve customers across all channels.

By moving to SuiteRetail's SuitePOS for NetSuite, Dylan's Candy Bar has greatly simplified their IT environment and gained all of the benefits of the cloud coupled with a modern POS proven capable of processing thousands of transactions per store each day. During their busiest Easter shopping days, Dylan's processed on average one in-store transaction every three seconds across all their locations with an astounding peak of one transaction every half second at their flagship New York City store and cafe.  

Dylan's took advantage of recently rolled out SuitePOS modules such as advanced promotions designed to encourage brand loyalty and shopper sign-up participation, weighed goods support, advanced Avalara AvaTax integration for complex sales tax calculations and multi-channel gift cards. As a result, SuitePOS has increased customer satisfaction and operational efficiencies.  

_"In SuitePOS for NetSuite, SuiteRetail has built a truly state of the art platform," said David Reid, CFO of Dylan's Candy Bar. "The combination of SuitePOS and its integration with NetSuite is allowing us to see the benefits of multi-channel customer support, point-of-sale tax checking, enhanced CRM, and real time sales and profitability metrics. Most importantly for us, this is facilitating enhanced insight into our business and customers. SuiteRetail has also been a great partner to work with. Throughout the recent roll out, the team's responsiveness has been second-to-none."_

Management of all channels using a single platform is made possible by leading cloud ERP/CRM services such as NetSuite and Salesforce1\. In the case of NetSuite, while access to the service on the internet provides huge advantages to omnichannel retailers, the web is simply too slow at the point-of-sale for high-volume retailers like Dylan's. SuitePOS fills this gap and brings the power of the cloud into the mission-critical high volume in-store environment.

_"SuitePOS, our iPad and iPhone POS, uses unique off-line/on-line technology that offers the best of all worlds," said Jeff Schneider, Co-founder of SuiteRetail. "SuitePOS runs much faster and with better uptime than any other in-store, web-based POS solution ever could -- it is not web dependent -- yet it still communicates with cloud services such as NetSuite and Salesforce1 in real-time. This provides serious omnichannel retailers like Dylan's with the benefits of a cloud service to run their entire business, while providing the local speed and reliability they need from their in-store POS."_
